# Microservice_Group_Project
Microservice Project For Jonathan's Group Project

## Requesting Data
Once the microservice has been turned on and going into standby mode, as put into the microservice-test file, the way that you request data from the microservice is after filling out the entered files into the main.py terminal (will replace this with jonathan's program), and the array get's sent out over to the microservice program.

## Recieving Data
The way that you recieve data from the program will be from the text file, after the microservice reads through the array given by the main program, it will send out correct or incorrect depending on if it finds a effort amount entered into the main program or read by the csv file that doesn't match with the values of the Group_Estimate_Example.csv file.
